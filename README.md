# EEUITweaks User Interface Mods Collection Version 4.0.6

The goal of EEUITweaks is to be a collection of the individual UI.MENU (i.e. Extended Edition 2.x+) mods/patches/tweaks from the BeamDog UI Modding forum; packaged as a single WeiDU collection. The advantages are to automate the tedious manual editing of UI.MENU, simplify multiple mod installations (particularly after an update), and to provide a single source from which many EE GUI mods can be accessed. It does NOT install the full UI replacement environments, although it does support modding them.

EEUITweaks supports BGEE, BG2EE, BGEE/SoD, PST:EE, IWDEE, and EET with the BG2(default) and SoD (EET_gui) user interfaces. It also supports installing mods on the Dragonspear UI++, BG2EE GUI To BGEE, LeUI, Revised Dragon Scale, IWD GUI for BG2:EE and BG:EE, and IWD2 for BG2 replacement UIs. In all cases, it will skip attempting to install useless or invalid mods for a particular environment (e.g. transparent sidebars on Dragonspear UI++).

## Installation

To install the mod:

1. Copy setup-EEUITweaks.exe and the EEUITweaks directory tree to your game
   installation directory (contains the chitin.key file)

2. Run setup-EEUITweaks.exe, answering the questions it asks.
   Depending on where your game is installed and the security settings on your
   system, you may need to 'Run as Administrator'. In fact, it's probably a
   good idea just to do it anyway.

That's it! It should install with no problems.

## Components

### Mod Options ([Original thread](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/59740/mod-mods-options-bg-ee-sod-and-bg2-ee-tob))

Adds screens to see the list of installed UI mods inside the game and toggle option offered by these mods.

The new list screen is accessible from both
- an "Option" button on the start screen
- an "Option" button in the game's (original) "Option" screen

From the mod list screen you can access the list of options offered by the mod (if any).

### Hidden Game Options ([Original thread, same as "Mod Options"](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/59740/mod-mods-options-bg-ee-sod-and-bg2-ee-tob))

Uses the previous "Mod Options" UImod to give access to (vanilla) game options that are normally hidden and can only be changed by editing `baldur.lua`.

### lefreut's Character Creation Screens

Takes the Character creation screens from [Lefreut's Enhanced UI](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/61571/mod-lefreuts-enhanced-ui-for-bg1ee-sod-bg2ee-and-eet)
> Modify the character creation screens to something closer to the v1.3 look.

Applies on **unmodified BG:EE, BG2:EE or EET** (i.e. it is not installable over any LeUI variant, dragonspear++ or IWD:EE).

There are two options for this component : "default button position" or "reversed button position".
